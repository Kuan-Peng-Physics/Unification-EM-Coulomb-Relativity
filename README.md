Unification of Electric and Magnetic Fields from Coulomb's Law and the Postulates of Relativity

Introduction

This project presents a complete derivation of classical electrodynamics. It demonstrates that phenomena usually attributed to the magnetic field are not independent entities, but result directly from the application of relativistic principles to Coulomb's law.

Research Key Points 

Single Source Reduction: The entire electromagnetic system emerges solely from Coulomb's law.

Faraday's Law and Lorentz Force: These laws are mathematically derived as consequences of electric fields deformed by the motion of source charges.

Progressing Electric Field Model: A theory based on deformed electric fields, allowing for an explanation of induction without resorting to the concept of magnetic flux.

Technical Objective

The study unifies field generation (Faraday) and field action (Lorentz) by showing that magnetism is an effect resulting from the dynamics and geometry of moving Coulomb fields.
