# Unification of Electric and Magnetic Fields from Coulomb's Law and the Postulates of Relativity

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a complete derivation of classical electrodynamics. It demonstrates that phenomena usually attributed to the magnetic field are not independent entities, but result directly from the application of relativistic principles to **Coulomb's Law**.

## 🚀 Research Key Points

* **Single Source Reduction:** The entire electromagnetic system emerges solely from Coulomb's law as the unique fundamental interaction.
* **Faraday's Law and Lorentz Force:** These laws are mathematically derived as direct consequences of **electric fields deformed by the motion of source charges**.
* **Progressing Electric Field Model:** A theory based on deformed electric fields, allowing for a complete explanation of induction without resorting to the concept of magnetic flux.

## 🎯 Technical Objective
The study unifies **field generation** (Faraday’s Law) and **field action** (Lorentz Force) by showing that magnetism is not a separate physical reality, but an effect resulting from the dynamics and geometry of moving Coulomb fields.
